# Getting Things Done - David Allen

To be successful in your work is to be a good organizer. Especially among knowledge workers, whose everyday reality involves juggling dozens of tasks and projects at once.

In order to keep all the complex information of our lives in check, many of us end up treating our brains like an all-in- one filing cabinet, calendar and to-do list.

We misuse our brains by packing them with all different kinds of information as though they were portable data storage devices. Where were you in that document before you got interrupted?

By stuffing our heads with information about unfinished assignments, appointments and other miscellaneous obligations, we’re squandering our brains’ capacity to think. *And this eventually leads to our inability to concentrate fully on our actual work.*

## Why?

Because, whether we want them to or not, our brains are forever trying to work out our unsolved problems and reminding us about them at the most inopportune moments  – even if we’d rather deal with them later.


In order to work as efficiently as possible, we have to keep our minds from dwelling on anything unrelated to the task we’re performing at any given moment.

## In an ideal world

In an ideal world, you’d always be able to focus entirely on whatever you were doing at any given moment, whether you’re writing an email, talking to a colleague or mowing the lawn. You’d always be fully present and focused on just that one thing.

In reality, however, our brains have an irritating way of never quite letting us forget what else we still need to take care of. We all have nagging thoughts like *“Remember to buy toilet paper on the way home”* and *“Pay this month’s electricity bill”* even when we’re not in a position to do anything about them.

To make matters more complicated, we’re constantly bombarded with new information.

**Collection bucket**

In order to avoid this, you should always use a collection bucket, that is, a place outside your mind where you can deposit any piece of information or idea that’s bound to distract you.

This means if you’re writing a work email when you remember you should pay the electricity bill, you can just jot the task down on a piece of paper and keep focusing on your work.

## Free your mind

Having reliable external collection bucket frees up your mind so you can concentrate fully on your actual work. This system allows the mind to rest assured that it won’t lose or misplace any important information.

**If your collection buckets aren’t up to date, they’re no longer reliable, and your brain will begin to distrust them.**

To prevent your brain from losing faith in your collection buckets, you should make a habit of completely emptying all of them once a week.

If, upon review, the item is unimportant, take it off the list immediately.

If you can take care of it very quickly **in two minutes or less, do it immediately;**
If it’s important information, file it away in the correct place;

## Why Todo-lists sucks

In theory, we should take pains to include only concrete, practicable tasks on these lists, but in reality we write down projects, appointments, tasks and bits of information without distinguishing between them – which makes it too easy to lose track of the individual actionable tasks.
Instead *Todo-lists* should only include actionable tasks.

As discussed before: remove anything unimportant, take care of small tasks immediately and put appointments or deadlines into your calendar;

If it’s a complex activity (that is, if it requires more than one concrete task), turn it into a project with a clear goal;

All other tasks should end up on a Next Actions list.

## Projects

Allen defines a project as a desired result that necessitates taking more than one action step. Hence, writing one email is *not* a project, but organizing a meeting or planning a vacation is.

Once a project is identified by its desired result, it must be stored on the Projects list, which should be reviewed and updated regularly. The Projects list is where you should notate all projects that need to be completed in the near future.

According to David allen, when we know that such a list exists, we feel a sense of control, which helps us boost our productivity and relax at the same time.

During your weekly update of the list, you should always make sure that every project has a next task that finds its way onto the Next Actions list, because concrete tasks are what make it possible to achieve every goal.

## A calendar and a Next actions list.

The calendar serves only one purpose: to keep appointments. You should treat it as a holy territory that provides a fixed structure for planning the rest of your activities. **Anything bound to a certain day or hour – like a meeting or a doctor’s appointment – should be on it.**

All other tasks or concrete actions should be put onto your Next Actions list. This list lets you decide quickly what task is the most urgent whenever you have time to take care of something.

Regardless of where you are, you should always have your Next Actions list on your person. This will give you the flexibility to choose which task it makes the most sense to tackle next.

If you’ve planned and pre-selected your tasks well, you shouldn’t have too much trouble deciding which one it makes the most sense to perform. Imagine you’re at the airport and your flight is delayed for an hour. In this situation, ask yourself:

Which task can I accomplish in my current situation?; Which task can I finish in the time available?; Which task do I have enough energy for at the moment?; And most important, which has the highest priority?

Depending on the number of tasks you have on the list, sometimes it makes sense to have multiple Next Actions lists and distinguish them according to the context (for example “on the phone” or “on the computer”). If you sort out your tasks by place, you’ll know what you can do when at your desk, at a meeting or while waiting at the airport.

## Waiting for

More often than not, you also need to rely on other people who are responsible for other parts of each project.
For example, you may need to wait for input from a colleague for your presentation or hear back from a hotel regarding room availability. This doesn’t mean, however, that you have to relinquish all control over the progress of any of your projects.

Whenever you’re dependent on other people’s work – for example, you’re waiting for your colleague to send you some data for your presentation – it’s worth keeping a Waiting For list. This is where you note everything that other people have to deliver to you, along with their deadlines.

If you review and update this list each week, you will notice when someone hasn’t kept his or her promise to take care of a certain task within a certain period of time.

## Save day-specific information in your calendar.

Although you can plan a whole lot in advance, sometimes you have to wait on certain information before you can turn items in your collection bucket into concrete tasks or appointments.

Write yourself reminders on certain days on your calendar. This way, you know you’ll have to make a decision soon (for example, about attending a festival).

## Someday/Maybe list.

So what goes onto the **Someday/Maybe list**? Simply put, everything that doesn’t qualify for the Next Actions or Projects lists but shouldn’t be buzzing around in your head either. The Someday/Maybe list contains all things you haven’t been able to translate into concrete ideas or tasks just yet.

The Someday/Maybe list can also be split into sub-lists where you can keep ideas about your personal interests, such as: trips I’d like to take; wines I’d like to taste; and music I’d like to listen to.

Similar to the Next Actions lists, these lists help you locate the right information at the right time. After all, lists are generally a whole lot more dependable than your own memory.

## GTD

The goal of the GTD method is to feel relaxed and in control of all your current projects: to keep track of them and make sure that they are moving forward.

It’s essential that you trust your system, and that your productivity system is up-to-date and complete at all times. Your mind will only be at ease and able to concentrate fully on the task at hand if you trust your system.

By reviewing all your lists weekly, you’ll make sure that your system stays functional – each current project should be associated with at least one Next Action on an up-to-date, easy-to-find list. You will also have a bird’s-eye view of everything that’s going on. Reviewing helps you see the forest without losing sight of the trees.

It’s a good idea to plan your weekly review on, say, a Friday afternoon. This will allow you to close up shop for the weekend with a clear head and a sense of control.

## Planning

In general, project planning is a pretty unnatural and illogical process. The aim is to think out and schedule all the steps in advance, but you may not even have a clear goal in mind yet. Enter the natural planning method, which mirrors the way you perform your everyday actions.

An example of an everyday action might unfold like this: you feel hungry, and so you form a vague goal (“I gotta eat something”), and then specify it (“I’m craving pizza”), at which point a couple of ideas pop into your head about how to achieve this goal (“I can either bake a pizza myself, order in, or go to a restaurant”). Whatever steps you need to take in between become self-evident.

## Summary

In order to devote ourselves fully to our tasks, our minds need space. That’s why we should bundle all important information in a reliable productivity system outside our own heads.

What do you need to do to work effectively with a clear head?

Use your brain for thinking and leave information storage to external collection buckets, like notebooks and physical inboxes. This way, you don’t need to worry about all the tasks and ideas that pop in your head throughout the day.
